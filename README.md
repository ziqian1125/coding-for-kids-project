## Project status
Prototype has the UI finished at an acceptable level considering the time and skills constraints. As for functionalities, we have page navigation, carousel, forms, modals, collapsibles, which means that the website has some level of interactivity. In the future, the following features were considered to be added: Chatbot, AI teacher, possible widening of the courses domain (adding languages), Multiplayer / single player games, etc.
